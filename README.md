# CSS Layout Algorithm Demo

An interactive demo for switching between CSS layout algorithms (flow, flexbox, grid, positioned).

Try it out live: https://css-layout-algorithm-demo.netlify.app/

This demo is inspired by the article "Understaying Layout Algorithms": https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/understanding-layout-algorithms/

## Learning Goal

For me, it was fruitless to memorize individual CSS properties without seeing the bigger picture.
Only by understanding the underlying layout algorithms, I can make a mental CSS model that makes sense for me.

However, learning algorithms in theory is not enough, we need real code to learn it.
Therefore, this demo serves as a playground for experimenting with CSS layouts.

## Features

- Switch between different CSS layout algorithms
- Switch a few properties within a selected layout algorithm

## Further resources

Beside of the resources above, studying the architecture of Chrome-RenderingNG helped me to understand CSS: https://developer.chrome.com/articles/renderingng-architecture/

And even the Flutter rendering pipeline has some similarities with flexbox/grid: https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#layout-and-rendering
