# Triple Layout Teacher

An interactive demo for the three CSS layout algorithms "flow", "flexbox" and "grid".

**Try it out live:** https://triple-layout-teacher.netlify.app

This demo is inspired by the article "Understaying Layout Algorithms": https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/understanding-layout-algorithms/

## Learning Goal

For me, it was fruitless to memorize individual CSS properties without seeing the bigger picture.
Only by understanding the underlying layout algorithms, I can make a mental CSS model that makes sense for me.

Even though CSS can be AI-generated, I argue that an understanding of layout-algorithms is still helpful for fixing bugs within (generated) code.

Therefore, the Triple Layout Teacher serves as a playground for learning to layout.
Beside of the three main algorithms, it also includes some pieces of "positioned layout" (absolute, relative).

## Techstack

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
